      <h2>Peak of Freshness</h2>
      <p>As the fast food industry realizes the need to move to sourcing their products from indoor farms, Grow Pod Solutions could be a solution for companies that are seeking a higher quality crop that can be grown year-round. For example, Wendy's is removing the risk factors associated with outdoor agriculture and unpredictable weather, and providing itself with a constant supply of fresh produce by switching to indoor farming. Not only do consumers like the idea of supporting local farms, but businesses are also welcoming local suppliers as a way to improve quality, cut costs, and increase margins. Wendy's says that it expects to see social and environmental benefits from the shift as well, including the reduction of pesticides.</p>
      <p>Grow Pods have low energy requirements, patented water and air filtration, spectral tuned lighting, and a balanced sealed environment that eliminates the need for pesticides. The system is scalable and units can be stacked to create giant automated farms. George Natzic, president of Grow Pod Solutions, said that in addition to fast food companies, he expects to see increased interest in automated farms from the grocery industry. "Today, many grocery stores will have a section of organic produce," Natzic commented. "But imagine the consumer response when grocers offer fresh produce grown right next to their building."</p>
